## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Review the [README](README.md) for setup instructions
2. Check the Issues page for open tasks
3. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you're new to the project

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Find an issue you'd like to work on
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it to avoid duplicate efforts
- If you're proposing a new feature, open an issue first to discuss it

### 2. Create a Branch

Follow the naming convention with kebab-case:

```bash
# For features
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For chores/maintenance
git checkout -b chore/description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Follow the code quality guidelines below
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation if your changes affect user-facing features or developer workflows

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
yarn dev

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Run linting with auto-fix
yarn lint:fix

# Run build to ensure no build errors
yarn build
```

Ensure all checks pass before submitting.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch to GitHub
- Create a pull request with a clear description
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure all CI checks pass

## Code Quality

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- **ESLint**: Follow the configured ESLint rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is enforced via Prettier
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for new code where applicable

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Avoid code duplication—extract shared logic to `utils/`

### File Organization

- `pages/` — Next.js pages
- `components/` — React components
- `utils/` — Shared utilities and API logic
- `data/` — Static data files
- `public/` — Static assets
- `styles/` — Global styles
- `types/` — TypeScript type definitions

## Pull Request Process

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

**Examples:**

```
feat: add teammate
fix: resolve navigation issue on mobile
docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Before Submitting

1. **Run code quality checks**

   ```bash
   yarn lint
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Ensure your branch is up to date** with the base branch

3. **Write a clear PR description** explaining what changes you made and why

4. **Add screenshots/recordings** for UI changes

5. **Update meta title and description** if modifying pages

### PR Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run via CI
2. **Code review** by maintainers—address all feedback
3. **Approval and merge** by maintainers
